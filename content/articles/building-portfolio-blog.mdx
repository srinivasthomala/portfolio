When I decided to build my portfolio website, I wanted it to be more than just a showcase of my work. I envisioned a platform that would allow me to share both technical articles and personal blog posts while maintaining a clean, professional appearance.

## Starting Point: ByteGrad's Tutorial

I began with [ByteGrad's excellent tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUKptmUVIBM), which provided a solid foundation with:

- Modern tech stack (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- Clean component architecture
- Responsive design principles
- Framer Motion animations
- Email integration
- Dark mode implementation

## Key Modifications and Enhancements

### 1. Migration to Pages Router

### Original vs. Modified Architecture

ByteGrad's tutorial implements a single-page portfolio where all sections (About, Experience, Projects, Contact) exist on one page, using smooth scroll navigation between sections:

```typescript
// Original single-page approach
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Intro />
      <About />
      <Projects />
      <Skills />
      <Experience />
      <Contact />
    </main>
  );
}
```

I modified this to a multi-page architecture where each section is its own page, providing several advantages:

```typescript
// New pages-based structure
pages/
├── index.tsx          // Home page
├── about.tsx          // About page
├── projects.tsx       // Projects page
├── experience.tsx     // Experience page
├── contact.tsx        // Contact page
├── articles/          // Technical articles section
│   ├── index.tsx     // Articles listing
│   └── [slug].tsx    // Individual article pages
└── blog/             // Personal blog section
    ├── index.tsx     // Blog posts listing
    └── [slug].tsx    // Individual blog posts
```

### Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Content Organization**

   - Clear separation between portfolio sections and content pages
   - Dedicated spaces for technical articles and blog posts
   - Better URL structure (e.g., `/articles/nextjs-tutorial` instead of `/#articles`)

2. **SEO Advantages**

   - Individual pages are better for search engine indexing
   - Unique meta tags for each page
   - Clearer content hierarchy

3. **Enhanced User Experience**

   - Direct linking to specific content
   - Traditional navigation with browser back/forward support
   - Cleaner loading states

4. **Content Management**
   - Easier integration of MDX for articles and blog posts
   - Simplified content organization in separate directories
   - More scalable as content grows

### Implementation Details

The navigation was updated to support the new structure:

```typescript
// components/navigation.tsx
const links = [
  { name: "Home", path: "/" },
  { name: "About", path: "/about" },
  { name: "Projects", path: "/projects" },
  { name: "Articles", path: "/articles" },
  { name: "Blog", path: "/blog" },
  { name: "Contact", path: "/contact" },
];
```

Each page maintains its own state and layout while sharing common components:

```typescript
// pages/articles/index.tsx
export default function ArticlesPage() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Header title="Technical Articles" />
      <ArticlesList articles={articles} />
      <Pagination />
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

This architecture made it possible to:

- Add dedicated sections for technical articles and blog posts
- Implement proper content management with MDX
- Create better navigation experience
- Scale the content more effectively

### 2. Content Management with MDX

Implemented a dual-content system:

```typescript
// lib/mdx.ts
export function getArticles() {
  const articlesDir = path.join(process.cwd(), "content/articles");
  // ... content processing logic
}

export function getBlogs() {
  const blogDir = path.join(process.cwd(), "content/blog");
  // ... content processing logic
}
```

### 3. Dual Content Sections

Created separate sections for different content types:

- **Technical Articles**: In-depth technical tutorials and guides
- **Personal Blog**: More casual posts about career, interests, and journey

### 4. Enhanced Date Handling

Implemented proper timezone handling for content dates:

```typescript
const publishedAt = data.publishedAt.includes("T")
  ? data.publishedAt
  : `${data.publishedAt}T00:00:00-05:00`;
```

### 5. Dynamic Page Generation

Set up dynamic routing for both articles and blog posts:

```typescript
// pages/blog/[slug].tsx and pages/articles/[slug].tsx
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Generate paths for all content files
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // Fetch and process content for each page
}
```

## Technical Stack Details

### Core Technologies

- **Next.js 14**: For server-side rendering and optimal performance
