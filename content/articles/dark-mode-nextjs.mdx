# How to Easily Add Dark Mode to Your Next.js Website

When I saw dark modes on some websites, I always wondered how they did it. Every component smoothly transitioning when I switched the mode - was it simply reversing the colors, or was there more to it? I wanted to build it into my website one day.

I recently added dark mode to my portfolio website, and I came to know it isn't that hard but also not too simple to implement. In this guide, I'll show you how to do it in simple steps, breaking down each part of the process.

## My Journey with Dark Mode

Before diving into the code, let me share my experience. When I started implementing dark mode, I had a few requirements:

- It should feel natural and smooth
- It shouldn't flash the wrong theme when loading
- It should remember user's preference
- It should match system settings by default

After some research and experimentation, I found a solution that checks all these boxes. Let me show you how.

## Understanding the Basics

The first thing I learned was that dark mode isn't just about inverting colors. It's about:

- Choosing the right color palette for each mode
- Managing state across the entire application
- Handling user preferences effectively
- Creating smooth transitions

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Setting Up the Foundation

First, let's set up Tailwind CSS for dark mode:

```js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: "class",
  // ... rest of your config
};
```

Create a theme provider to manage the state:

```tsx
"use client";

import { createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";

type Theme = "light" | "dark";

type ThemeContextType = {
  theme: Theme;
  toggleTheme: () => void;
};

const ThemeContext = createContext<ThemeContextType | null>(null);

export function ThemeProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>("light");

  useEffect(() => {
    const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem("theme") as Theme;
    const systemTheme = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")
      .matches
      ? "dark"
      : "light";

    setTheme(savedTheme || systemTheme);
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark", theme === "dark");
    localStorage.setItem("theme", theme);
  }, [theme]);

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme((prev) => (prev === "light" ? "dark" : "light"));
  };

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

### 2. Creating the Theme Toggle

Build a simple toggle button:

```tsx
"use client";

import { useTheme } from "./theme-provider";
import { SunIcon, MoonIcon } from "@heroicons/react/24/outline";

export function ThemeToggle() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={toggleTheme}
      className="p-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 transition-colors"
      aria-label={`Switch to ${theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light"} theme`}
    >
      {theme === "light" ? (
        <MoonIcon className="w-5 h-5" />
      ) : (
        <SunIcon className="w-5 h-5" />
      )}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### 3. Preventing Flash of Wrong Theme

This was tricky! I added this script to my `layout.tsx` to prevent the flash:

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <head>
        <script
          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
            __html: `
              (function() {
                function getTheme() {
                  const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme')
                  if (savedTheme) return savedTheme

                  return window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches
                    ? 'dark'
                    : 'light'
                }

                document.documentElement.classList.toggle(
                  'dark',
                  getTheme() === 'dark'
                )
              })()
            `,
          }}
        />
      </head>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 4. Styling Your Components

Here's how I style components to support both themes:

```tsx
export function Card({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div
      className="
      bg-white dark:bg-gray-800
      text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100
      border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700
      rounded-lg p-6
      transition-colors duration-200
    "
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 5. Adding Smooth Transitions

To make theme changes smooth, I added these styles to my global CSS:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  body {
    @apply transition-colors duration-200;
  }
}
```

## Common Challenges I Faced

### 1. The Flash of Incorrect Theme

When I first implemented dark mode, users would see a flash of light theme before the dark theme loaded. This happened because:

- The theme check happens after JavaScript loads
- The initial HTML renders with default (light) theme

**Solution:**
I added a small script in the document head that runs before the page renders. This script:

- Checks localStorage for any saved preference
- Falls back to system dark mode preference if no saved theme
- Applies the correct theme immediately

```tsx
// Add this script to the <head> of your document
const themeScript = `
  (function() {
    // Check localStorage first
    const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem("theme");
    if (savedTheme) {
      document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark", savedTheme === "dark");
      return;
    }
    
    // Fall back to system preference
    const systemTheme = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches;
    document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark", systemTheme);
  })()
`;
```

### 2. Transition Timing Issues

Initially, my color transitions felt either too slow or too jarring. After testing different durations:

**Solution:**
I found that 200ms provides the perfect balance - quick enough to feel responsive but slow enough to be noticeable. I applied this transition to all color changes using Tailwind's base layer. For elements that shouldn't animate (like loading states), I added a utility class to disable transitions.

```css
@layer base {
  * {
    @apply transition-colors duration-200;
  }

  /* Exclude certain elements from transition */
  .no-transition {
    @apply transition-none;
  }
}
```

### 3. Color Palette Challenges

Some colors that looked great in light mode didn't work well in dark mode. The key is avoiding pure black and white.

**Solution:**
Instead of using extreme contrasts, I used Tailwind's zinc scale which provides softer, more natural colors. Dark grays are easier on the eyes than pure black, and slightly off-white is more comfortable than pure white.

```tsx
// Don't use pure black/white
const badExample = {
  light: "bg-white text-black", // Too harsh
  dark: "dark:bg-black dark:text-white", // Too extreme
};

// Instead, use softer colors
const goodExample = {
  light: "bg-zinc-50 text-zinc-900", // Softer light theme
  dark: "dark:bg-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100", // Easier on eyes
};
```

### 4. System Preference Changes

Initially missed handling real-time system preference changes. Users switching their system theme wouldn't see updates until refresh.

**Solution:**
I added a media query listener that updates the theme when system preferences change, but only if the user hasn't set a manual preference. This respects both system changes and user choices.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)");

  const handleChange = (e: MediaQueryListEvent) => {
    if (!localStorage.getItem("theme")) {
      setTheme(e.matches ? "dark" : "light");
    }
  };

  mediaQuery.addEventListener("change", handleChange);
  return () => mediaQuery.removeEventListener("change", handleChange);
}, []);
```

### 5. Images and Dark Mode

Some images, especially those with light backgrounds, looked out of place in dark mode.

**Solution:**
I created an adaptive image component that slightly inverts images in dark mode. This maintains visibility while matching the theme. The transition duration matches our color transitions for consistency.

```tsx
export function AdaptiveImage({ src, alt }: ImageProps) {
  return (
    <div className="dark:invert-[.95] transition-[filter] duration-200">
      <Image
        src={src}
        alt={alt}
        className="rounded-lg bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Testing Your Implementation

Here's my checklist for testing dark mode:

- Check initial load in both modes
- Test system preference detection
- Verify smooth transitions
- Ensure persistence across refreshes

## Next Steps and Improvements

After implementing the basic dark mode, here are some ways you can enhance it:

### 1. Toggle Animation

Add a smooth animation to your theme toggle:

```tsx
export function ThemeToggle() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={toggleTheme}
      className="relative overflow-hidden rounded-lg bg-zinc-100 p-2 
                hover:bg-zinc-200 dark:bg-zinc-800 dark:hover:bg-zinc-700"
    >
      <div
        className={`transition-transform duration-200 ${
          theme === "dark" ? "-rotate-180" : "rotate-0"
        }`}
      >
        {theme === "light" ? (
          <MoonIcon className="h-5 w-5" />
        ) : (
          <SunIcon className="h-5 w-5" />
        )}
      </div>
    </button>
  );
}
```

### 2. Performance Optimization

- Use CSS variables for dynamic values
- Minimize DOM updates during theme changes
- Lazy load theme-specific assets

### 3. Edge Cases

- Handle prefers-reduced-motion
- Support high contrast mode
- Manage iframe content themes
- Handle third-party widget themes

### 4. User Experience

- Add theme switch sound effects
- Save theme preference to user account
- Add keyboard shortcuts for theme toggle
- Provide theme switch preview

## Conclusion

Looking back, implementing dark mode was a rewarding experience. It not only improved my website's user experience but also taught me valuable lessons about state management and user preferences.
