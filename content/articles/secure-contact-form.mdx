# Adding a Professional Contact Form to Your Website

Ever wanted to add a contact form to your website but thought it would be too complicated? In this guide, I'll show you how to create a professional contact form with email integration and content moderation - and it's easier than you might think!

## What We'll Build

- A beautiful contact form with dark mode support
- Email integration that actually works
- Basic protection against spam and inappropriate content

## Understanding Resend: The Easy Way to Send Emails

Resend is like Gmail for your website - it's a simple service that lets your website send emails. Instead of setting up complex email servers, you just:

1. Sign up at [Resend](https://resend.com)
2. Get an API key
3. Use it to send emails

It's that simple! Here's what makes Resend great:

- Free tier for developers
- Simple setup process
- Beautiful email templates
- Reliable delivery

## Step 1: Setting Up

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install resend @react-email/components
```

Add your Resend API key to your `.env` file:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Step 2: Creating the Contact Form

Here's a simple form component that looks great and handles submissions:

```typescript
export default function Contact() {
  async function handleSubmit(e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget);
    const result = await sendEmail(formData);

    if (result.success) {
      toast.success("Message sent!");
    }
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="email" placeholder="Your email" />
      <textarea placeholder="Your message" />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Step 3: Setting Up Email Sending

Creating an email template is as simple as writing React components:

```typescript
export default function ContactFormEmail({ message, senderEmail }) {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Body>
        <Heading>New message from your website</Heading>
        <Text>{message}</Text>
        <Text>From: {senderEmail}</Text>
      </Body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

## Step 4: Adding Content Moderation

Now, here's where it gets interesting. We want to protect our form from inappropriate content, but we don't need anything complex. Here's a simple approach:

```typescript
export class ContentAnalyzer {
  // Simple check for inappropriate content
  static analyze(content: string) {
    const suspicious = [
      // List of patterns to check
      /\b(spam|inappropriate)\b/i,
      /[A-Z]{10,}/, // Too many caps
      /(http|ftp|https):\/\//i, // Links
    ];

    return {
      isSafe: !suspicious.some((pattern) => pattern.test(content)),
      reason: "Contains inappropriate content",
    };
  }
}
```

That's it! This simple checker can:

- Detect inappropriate words
- Spot suspicious patterns
- Block obvious spam

## Putting It All Together

Here's how we use everything together:

```typescript
export async function sendEmail(formData: FormData) {
  const message = formData.get("message");

  // Check content
  if (!ContentAnalyzer.analyze(message).isSafe) {
    return { error: "Please keep messages appropriate" };
  }

  // Send email
  const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: "Your Website <onboarding@resend.dev>",
    to: "your@email.com",
    subject: "New Contact Message",
    react: ContactFormEmail({ message, senderEmail }),
  });
}
```

## That's Really It!

You now have a professional contact form that:

- Sends emails reliably
- Looks great
- Works in dark mode
- Blocks inappropriate content
- Handles errors gracefully

The best part? You can customize each piece to match your needs:

- Add more content checks
- Customize the email template
- Style the form to match your site
- Add rate limiting if needed
