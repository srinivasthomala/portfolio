Welcome to my personal blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and journey with you. As a software engineer at Bloomberg L.P., I'll be writing about various topics that interest me both professionally and personally.

## What to Expect

While my [Articles](/articles) section focuses on in-depth technical tutorials and programming guides, this blog will be a more personal space covering:

- **Career Journey**: Sharing experiences and lessons from my software engineering path, from India to the United States
- **Learning & Growth**: Exploring new technologies, sharing learning experiences, and documenting my skill development journey
- **Personal Projects**: Updates on side projects and experiments I'm working on
- **Book Reviews & Recommendations**: Sharing interesting reads related to technology and personal growth
- **Personal Growth**: Experiences with MMA training, guitar learning, and other interests outside tech
- **Entertainment Corner**: Reviews and discussions about games, anime series, and films that inspire me

## Why Start a Blog?

I believe in the power of sharing both knowledge and experiences. Through this blog, I aim to:

- Share a more personal perspective on tech and life
- Document my journey in both professional and personal growth
- Connect with others who share similar interests
- Create a space for casual discussions about tech, gaming, anime, and more

## Join Me on This Journey

I plan to post regularly about topics that I find interesting and valuable. Whether you're a fellow software engineer, anime enthusiast, gamer, or just curious about my journey, I hope you'll find something worthwhile here.
