# Image Examples

## Basic Image

Here's a basic image with alt text:

![A sample image](/images/profilepic.jpeg)

## Profile Image Example

Perfect for profile pictures or avatars:

![Profile picture example](/images/profilepic.jpeg)

## Multiple Images Example

Sometimes you need to show multiple images:

![First example](/images/profilepic.jpeg)
![Second example](/images/profilepic.jpeg)
![Third example](/images/profilepic.jpeg)

## Image with Description

When you need to provide more context:

![Detailed image description](/images/profilepic.jpeg)

This image is being used as a placeholder. You can replace it with your actual images later.

## Image Best Practices

1. Always include descriptive alt text
2. Use clear, high-quality images
3. Optimize images for web use
4. Consider the context and placement
5. Use appropriate image sizes

Remember to:

- Place images in the `/public/images/` directory
- Reference them starting with `/images/` in MDX files
- Use meaningful alt text for accessibility
- Optimize images before uploading
